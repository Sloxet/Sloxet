During my early years, I had gone undiagnosed with High-Functioning Autism, which means that I learn and understanding things differently. Consequently, I was given an education which didn't accommodate my needs, and I remained disinterested in my school subjects. Instead, I dedicated the entirety of my time to learning the intricacies of computers and electronics. Because of my own discoveries and a deep passion for computer science, I acquired enough skills to leave high school. Thereafter, I would kickstart my own technology company, Vorteer Technologies Ltd.

My choice was further validated by receiving the Public Service Through Technology Award from the Wisconsin Amateur Radio Emergency Service â€” This award is presented yearly to individuals who have demonstrated a clever use of technology to benefit their community. Alongside obtaining my Radio Technicians Licence from the Federal Communications Commission, I had no doubt that I was embarking on a journey toward success.

Some years later, I would begin attending classes by Todd Krause of the National Weather Service in the Twin Cities, Minnesota. This experience would lead me to truly understand of the intricacies of government computer systems and how to maintain them at the highest level of security and reliability. The opportunity given to me by the National Weather Service would also lead me towards providing patch management services for the United States Department of Commerce in Reno, Nevada, and Glasgow, Montana apropos of the Remote Off-Air Monitoring System.

Aside from my achievements after founding Vorteer Technologies Ltd., I have also been a backend developer for several video game platforms. In 2015, I worked with Happy Ninja Games LLC. And, three years later, I joined BrickPlanet Inc., where my expertise was instrumental in the platform's success. At BrickPlanet, I maintained critical database management systems that supported the in-game economy of said platform. My proficiency in database design and optimisation, and my ability to write efficient and reliable code, ensured that the platform's payment processing systems would bear secure and reliable transactions.
